Hi! My name is Xinyan Li, pronouncing like Shinyan Lee. If you can read Pinyin, it pronounces Lǐ Xīn Yán. Also, you can call me Rita as my English name if you want.  

And yes, I do have access to a computer with an Internet connection at home.

I’ve done programming and scripting before. To me, I’m not good at it, and it’s boring and difficult.

I don’t have a job.

I take 4 courses this semester. 3 are IT courses.

If you mean fun fact, then I think I’m a pretty dull person. The only thing I enjoy is staying at my room, watching movies or Tiktok videos, reading books, and playing online games.

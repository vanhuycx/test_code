My name is Edwin, I'm a IT junior at UMass. I have access to a computer with internet. I know some of Python, C++ and Java, but I am learning R as well. This year I'm taking 4 classes in total, anf only two of them are IT courses. I do have a job, and road trips or anything interesting to do is what takes my time off. I got a dog named Mocha.

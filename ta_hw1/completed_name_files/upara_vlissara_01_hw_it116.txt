My name is Vlissara, Thai people always have a nickname I don't know why so my nickname is Jula, and feel free to call me this name. I'm a freshman majoring in Information Technology. I do have a laptop and an internet connection at home and I have done programming(Python, Unix, C, C++, R) before but they weren't my cup of tea. I have a part-time job as a caretaker. I work less than 12 hours per week. I take 4 classes 3 IT and 1 history. I might seem less interactive in the class but not because of shyness. every so often I take some time to warm up and digest my thoughts.Â

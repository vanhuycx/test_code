My name is Adnan Ghari (Aad-Nan), I prefer to be called Ad. My name is often mispronounced. I have internet access at home along with a computer. I have some experience in programming, It was a fun experience to learn the language itself however it's very time-consuming. I often work 10 - 12 hours a week which is mostly weekends. I am currently taking 4 courses in which two of which are IT-based courses. Whenever I get a chance to myself I am either working on my project car, doing some photography, or playing with my collection of Rubik's cubes. I am a senior stylist at the Banana Republic, my job is to dress a customer to the best setting of the environment they wish to proceed in.

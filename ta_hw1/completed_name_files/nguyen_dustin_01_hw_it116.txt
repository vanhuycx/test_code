Hi, my name is Dustin.  And I go by Dustin as shown. I do have computer access with an internet connection. Have I ever done programming? Yes, I have. I had taken Intro to Java last semester. My experience with the class was fun I enjoyed creating the programs needed for the assignment whether it be from creating a function or an image.  I am currently working as a barista at a coffee shop. And I work between 18-30ish hours a week. I am taking five courses this semester. Three of my courses are IT and the other two are science and math. I'm a big foodie person so I love going out to try stuff. I also play video games whenever I have free time. I also enjoy working out as it mentally makes me feel better.

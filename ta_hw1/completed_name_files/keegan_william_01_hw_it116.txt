My full name is William Keegan but I prefer to go by Will. Yes, I have access to a computer with internet access at home. I have done a little bit of programming, I took Intro to Java last year as well as completed a unit on Python in IT-110. I am not currently working. I am taking 6 courses this semester as well as completing my pre-practicum. Of those 6 courses, 3 of them are IT courses. I am a senior IT major on the computer forensics track minoring in secondary education via the UTeach program. In my free time I play on the club baseball team here at UMB where I am a utility player.

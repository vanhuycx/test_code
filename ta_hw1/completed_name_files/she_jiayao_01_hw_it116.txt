My name is Jiayao She, and feel free to call my English name Gary if you prefer.
I do have access to a computer with an Internet connection at home.
I have done some programming such as C, C++, Java, and Golang.
I am currently not working.Â 
I am taking 5 courses this semester. Three courses are computer science, one course from IT and the last one is science.
I am a senior computer science student, and I would like to learn more about Python before graduating.
I finished a QA internship at Crypto.com this summer. I am a big fan of cryptocurrencies, and this work experience gave me more interest in blockchain technologies.

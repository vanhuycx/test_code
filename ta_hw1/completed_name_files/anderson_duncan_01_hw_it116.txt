My Name is Duncan Anderson. I go by Duncan, which is pronounced as it’s spelled. I have a computer at my house that has a connection to the Internet. I’m a freshman, and most of my experience with programming and scripting is from previous courses I’ve taken, or personal projects. I work for my town’s public school’s IT department as an intern, and I usually work 12 to 18 hours each week. I’ve been working mainly on managing inventory and resolving teachers’ and students’ issues. I am taking 6 classes this semester, 3 of which are science, engineering, mathematics, computer science, or IT courses.

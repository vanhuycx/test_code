Hello, my name is Amani Woods and I'm a third year IT student. Amani is what I prefer to be called. I do have internet at home and I have done Python (working with Pycharm in my CS 110 class). I do currently have a job and I work 25 hours a week! I am taking 5 courses this semester -- three on Tuesdays and Thursdays and two on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I'm taking two IT courses (IT 110 and IT 116) and I'm taking a stats class. There's really not much to tell you about myself, other than I like to keep to myself unless I have to ask for help from a peer or the professor.

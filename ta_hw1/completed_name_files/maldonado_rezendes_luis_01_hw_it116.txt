My name is Luis Maldonado Rezendes. I go by Luis. I have access to the Internet and a computer at home. I took a python programming class my sophomore year of high school but I don't remember much from that class. I currently intern in an IT department where I work part-time. I work about 27 hours a week. I am taking 5 classes this semester. I have 2 IT classes this semester. On my free time I like to hang out with friends and go for drives.

Hi everyone my name is Huangyue Chen, I go by Audrey. I do not have any job at this moment. I am currently a senior majoring in marketing so I do not have any experience in IT, this is my first IT course. I am currently taking 4 courses this semester and I have access to a laptop and the internet. A fun fact about me is that I hate fish.Â

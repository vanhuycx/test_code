Hello to everyone. My name is Ilhan Sharif. I prefer to be addressed by my first name (Ilhan). I'm a new transfer student and the first generation in my family to attend college, which I'm very proud of. Yes, I have internet access at home. This semester, I'll be taking five classes. Three of them are IT classes. I've never taken an IT class before, and I'm very interested in learning more about it.

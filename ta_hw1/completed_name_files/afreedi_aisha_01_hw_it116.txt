My name is Aisha Afreedi. I go by Aisha. I have access to both a computer and internet at home. I have taken IT110 and I took IT244 with you. I do not work. This semester I am taking five courses. Only one of them is an IT course. The rest of my classes are business classes. Some fun facts about me are that I love to travel and I love cats. I have three of them.

Greetings, my name is Nicholas Lynch or just Nick for short. I'm currently a sophomore here at UMB enrolled in five courses three of which are IT-related courses. Yes, I do currently have access to a computer with an internet connection at my home in Brockton. Yes, I do enjoy programming which I have done in both IT 210 and in high school AP CS mainly in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Yes, I currently have two jobs I work as a Front End Supervisor at OSJL and as security personnel for APS, I work typically around 30-40 hours a week. Some of my favorite unique hobbies are fishing both saltwater/freshwater and running, with my favorite food being grilled striper but any freshly caught seafood is amazing.

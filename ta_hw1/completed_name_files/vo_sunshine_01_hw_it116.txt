My name is Sunshine Vo.
I do have access to a computer with an Internet connection at home. 
I have done python scripts to transferred/edited data for an assignment in an internship as a NAF intern with a company called Optum. But that was a few years ago, so I don't remember that much. 
I work part time and I usually work 20 hours or less a week. 
I am taking four courses this semester
Two of the courses I am taking are mathematics and this IT course.
A little about me is I'm currently undecided, but I am looking into declaring my major in IT. 
For work, I have been doing retail in a clothing store for a little over a year now.

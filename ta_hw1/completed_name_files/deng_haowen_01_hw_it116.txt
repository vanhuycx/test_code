Hi, my is Haowen Deng, It pronouns like (Hao Wen), this is my second IT course, but I have 3 IT courses for this semester, so I don't have much experience and knowledge about IT, but this is what I am here for. the reason that stops me for taking 5 courses instead of 4 courses is that 3 out of my 4 courses are IT courses. one fun fact is Professor Glenn is also my major advisor and I am taking his IT 244 with this course at the same time.Â

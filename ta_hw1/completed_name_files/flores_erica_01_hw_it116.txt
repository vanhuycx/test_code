My name is Erica Flores, I do have access to a computer and internet access at home.

I currently work part time as a bartender and cocktail server on the weekends.

I am taking 5 classes, 4 are IT. I am 26 years old, my major is information systems and I should be graduating by May 2022. I took IT MSIS 230L (Relational Databases) during the summer and learned a bit of SQL. I am very interesting in learning Python and coding in general. In my free time I like to run, journal, read and spend time with family, friends and dog.
